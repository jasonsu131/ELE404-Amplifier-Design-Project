The objective of this lab was to design, simulate, analyze, implement, and test a single-supply,
multistage, inverting, transistor amplifier which fulfills a set of specifications. Bipolar-Junction Transistors in active mode are utilized to create the multistage amplifier. 
Results were checked with values obtained from the simulated circuit and the specifications requirements below:

- Power supply: +𝟏𝟎𝑽 relative to the ground;
- Quiescent current drawn from the power supply: no larger than 𝟏𝟎 𝒎𝑨;
- No-load voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): |𝑨𝒗𝒐| = 𝟓𝟎 (± 𝟏𝟎%);
- Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): no smaller than 8 V peak to peak;
- Loaded voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and with 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): no smaller than 𝟗𝟎% of the no-load voltage gain;
- Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): no smaller than 4 V peak to peak;
- Input resistance (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): no smaller than 𝟐𝟎 𝒌𝜴;
- Amplifier type: inverting or non-inverting;
- Frequency response: 20 Hz to 50 kHz (−𝟑𝒅𝑩 response);
- Type of transistors: BJT;
- Number of transistors (stages): no more than 3;
- Resistances permitted: values smaller than 𝟐𝟐𝟎 𝒌𝜴 from the E24 series;
- Capacitors permitted: 𝟎. 𝟏 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏. 𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟐. 𝟐 𝝁𝑭, 𝟒. 𝟕 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟒𝟕 𝝁𝑭, 𝟏𝟎𝟎 𝝁𝑭, 𝟐𝟐𝟎 𝝁𝑭;
- Other components (BJTs, diodes, Zener diodes, etc.): only from your ELE404 lab kit.

Notes:
- The output voltage must be free from distortions (clipping, etc.) in all test conditions.
- The source resistance, 𝑅𝑠, must be 600 Ω for all tests.
